# Mission and motivation

Our mission is to design governance software and protocols which enable people to bootstrap and grow pluralistic and transparent open source communities.

Two of the most useful functionalities for open source community governance are polls and referendums. Polls are commonly used for prioritizing work, such as issues or pull-requests. Whereas referendums are used for approving changes to the source of the community, its membership or its governing rules.

Every community is unique, which is why a successful governance software must accommodate different types of balloting mechanisms, ranging from traditional one-person-one-vote to modern approaches such as Quadratic Voting and all of its flavors.

Modern community mechanisms also utilize a range of community-scoped tokens (such as fungible/non-fungible, transferable/non-transferable) as a way of bookkeeping member contributions.
Therefore, no governance solution is complete without support for community-scoped member accounts and services for community-specific tokens.

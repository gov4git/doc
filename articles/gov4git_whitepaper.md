# gov4git: Governance for git

Our journey into "governance for git" begins with a real-world use case: [The Plurality Book project](XXX). The book project was conceived in October of 2022 with the objective of crowdsourcing the authoring of a new book on the subject of technologies for digital democracy. By design, this is an open source project aiming to harness the expertise of many loosely (or not at all) related contributors across multiple countries in various capacities, such as translation, fact-checking, original research, discovery of prior art, typesetting, and so on.

Due to the sheer scale of this project — anticipating a number of contributors in the hundreds or thousands, well-beyond the Dunbar limit — an ad-hoc approach to community organization is likely to lead to subpar results. This prompted us to pursue a systemic approach towards designing a flexible and secure solution for governance needs with practicality and rapid path-to-deployment being non-negotiable.

From an application point of view, the book project needs to perform a variety of community organization procedures:
- Maintain a registry of the identities of its contributors
- Maintain a fine-grained differentiation of roles and responsibilities of individual contributors, such as "organizer", "translator for Korean", "typesetter", "editor for chapter 4" and so on.
- Rewards contributors with virtual certificates some of which may have community scope, such badges or voting credits, while others may have exogenous e.g. blockchain-scope, such as SBTs or hypercerts.
- Perform fair community polls to resolve questions of prioritization, such as "Which issues or pull request should be addressed first?"
- Define and enforce fine-grain policies governing the arbitration and approval processes for changes in various parts of the project. Some examples of policies are:
  - "Changes to Chapter 1 can be approved by the organizer"
  - "Changes to Chapter 2 require a majority vote across contributors who are translators, based on a given quadratic voting rule"
  - "Changes to the governing policies requires a one-person-one-vote referendum across all contributors, or an approval by the organizer."
- Perform services for the community members. Some examples of services are:
  - "Transfer XXX"
